\quad The purpose of this dissertation is to build an web application for project management.\\
\null\quad The main target of the application is to be simple of use and satisfy basic
needs for an easy and efficient management of projects.\\
\null\quad Therefore, the user after having created an account will be able to manage
or join multiple projects. One project involves one or more
users with different roles (manager, member, project manager). Any member of the team will be able to assign assignments to one or more of it's project colleagues using or not assignment dependencies.\\
\null\quad In addition, the user will be able to monitor all assignments that have been assigned to him across all active projects, but also the project assignments in particular. Visual representation is available in both cases in form of Pie Chart and Gantt chart.\\
\null\quad As well, each project has a communication channel for smooth flow of it and a general calendar where personal or project events are added.\\
\null\quad The second objective of this dissertation seeing implementation is to correctly combine two well-known programming paradigms, namely "Objective Oriented" and "Reactive".\\
\null\quad The technologies to be used follow the 'MEAN' package: MongoDB as a database, ExpressJS for server-side organizing, the powerful Angular (6.0.0-beta7) for client-side and NodeJS as server, adding Socket.io and RxJS to this list.
